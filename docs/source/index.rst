Motivation
==========

This project is a POC (Proof of concept) of a public 1.0 blockchain, covering
the requirements at the 'white paper' of `bitcoin`_. We intended to understand
more about how blockchains worked and how we could implement one using Python
with Flask micro web framework and Docker.
